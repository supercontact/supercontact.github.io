		<h4>ARCraft - A mobile AR application that lets you build a "Minecraft" world right on your desktop</h4>
		<datetime>Jan. 2017</datetime>
		<p class="author">Ruoqi He, Xinyi Yang, Yali Zhu, Zhiling Peng</p>
		<p><img src="articles/1/thumb.png" class="floatLeft" style="width: 200px;"></img>This android app we developed allows you to create miniature worlds with a 3D pixel (voxel) style on your desk. Print the markers and put them on the desk, then look through the screen of your smartphone - you will see a 3D canvas on the desk where you can add voxels to build a 3D model. The app features an interactive 3D cursor that stays behind your smartphone with a fixed distance. Using it you can draw freely in the 3D space by simply moving your smartphone. A complete set of tools are also provided to help you build and color your 3D models. We also allow you to create more complex scenes by first creating your custom set of objects, then using them as bricks to build the world.</p>
		<p>Some features:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Create and delete blocks at 3D cursor position in workspace. Three modes are supported:
				<ol>
					<li>Discrete mode - Add/remove blocks one at a time</li>
					<li>Continuous mode - Hold the button to continuously add/remove blocks</li>
					<li>Box mode - Drag a box and add/remove blocks in the whole area</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>A virtual 3D color picker allows you to select color for your block</li>
			<li>Paint the blocks by drawing on the screen with your finger</li>
			<li>Rotate the workspace along three axis via flick gestures</li>
			<li>Rotate the selected custom block via flick gestures in order to place it in different poses</li>
			<li>A warehouse area that stores all your custom objects and worlds</li>
			<li>Save & load your work</li>
		</ul>

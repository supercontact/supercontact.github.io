		<h2>Photo Magician - An image browser which allows you to manage and annotate images</h2>
		<datetime>Oct. 2016</datetime>
		<p class="author">Ruoqi He</p>
		<p><img src="articles/PhotoMagician/thumb.png" class="floatRight" style="width: 200px;"></img>I made an image browser that allows you to manage your images by giving them tags, and make annotations on each image. By annotation I mean making free drawings or writing text on the back of the image. This application has everything essential of an image viewer, while also providing extra functionalities such as tagging and filtering. Although it's a college project, I'm making it a tool that will truly come in handy to myself when it comes to managing my image collections.</p>
		<p>Features include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Load up your images and store them as an album</li>
			<li>Add multiple tags to images</li>
			<li>Show images having the given tags</li>
			<li>Browse through your images with different scale modes (original, fit width, fit window, etc.)</li>
			<li>Scroll images by dragging</li>
			<li>Flip an image to make annotation: Draw lines, rectangles or ellipses, add text with line wrap</li>
			<li>Change the color and width of your strokes, Change the size and font of your text</li>
			<li>Support undo with ctrl+z</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I'm still planning to extend it in the future with a multi-filesystem styled tagging system (supporting AND/OR/NOT operators to a combination of tag filters), along with optimizations such as thumbnail caching.</p>
